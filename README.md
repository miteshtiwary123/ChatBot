# ChatBot using OpenAI

I have created this ChatBot using OpenAI.
I have created frontend using PyQt6. In this app i have three files 
1. main.py
2. backend.py
3. config.py
in config file we store our API key. so in order to run this app you need to create a config file and store yor API key in API_KEY variable.

In backend file i am getting response from openAI using user input and return the response.

In main file i have created chat area, input field, and button. Capturing user input from input field and send it to backend then i get response from backend and showed the response in chat area.
